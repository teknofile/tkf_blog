There hasn’t been a post in awhile, but that doesn’t mean I’ve not been busy.

I had been thinking of participating in the Hacky Easter event, but I don’t think I’ll even be able to register, much less participate.

Oh well.

I typically hate the “oh yeah, I’ve been doing so many cool things stay tuned” posts, but here I am writing one.

I’ve been in the process behind the curtains moving sites around and building new infrastructure. Stay tuned for some info on how I’m managing this site (along with several others) using Terraform and Ansible, specifically how I do them “securely”.
