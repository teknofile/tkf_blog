<p>I've spent a fair amount of time wondering where my path takes me. While I've had a great passion for InfoSec, security in general but mostly red teaming and penetration testing. Those of you who know me best, know that I do have not 'officially' worked for a security department. Most of my career has landed within the realm of 'General IT' departments or consulting firms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“They always say time changes things,<br /></em><em>but you actually have to<br />change them yourself.”</em><br />-- <a class="authorOrTitle" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1203.Andy_Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, <span id="quote_book_link_31818"><a class="authorOrTitle" href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1283844">The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My heart tells me to follow the path towards a real red team. That doesn't mean I'm switching jobs. Leaving a place that has invested in me. Nor anything work related.</p>
<p>It does mean I want to spend some time on refining some skills that I have had seldom chances to use in the past several years. Usually, I don't give much stock in certifications, but after much research, I do think the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)</a> has some value.</p>
<p>This page, which I thought originally was going to be just-another-blog-post, will be a work in progress. As I continue the journey, I'll be updating links on useful pre-training to prepare myself. If someone else out in the ether may benefit I do hope they let me know. The target audience is primarily myself.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
